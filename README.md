Interactive B-Tree Index File Manager:

This project is my implementation of an interactive B-Tree index file anager. It uses a B-tree data structure to manage and store key-value pairs in an organized and efficient way. The program offers basic functionalities like creating, searching,and managing index files, all while adhering to constraints like limited memory and file-based storage. While the project may not include all possible features, it reflects my understanding and effort to tackle a complex problem using the knowledge Iâ€™ve gained so far.

-Create, open, and manage index files.
-Insert and serch key-value pairs.
-Print or export the B-tree contents.
-Load key-value pairs from a file.

The program adheres to constraints are:
-Storing no more than three nodes in memory at a time.
-Using 512-byte blocks for storage.
-Implementing the B-tree logic with a minimum degree of 10.

Feautures are:
- Create Index Files: Creates a new index file with proper headers and initializes an empty B-tree.
- Open Index Files: Opens and verifes an existing index file based on a magic number.
- Insert Key-Value Pairs: Inserts pairs into the B-tree structure while handling overflows.
- Search Keys: Searches the B-tree for specific keys and retrieves the corresponding values.
- Export Data: Saves the B-tree contents as a CSV file.
- Load Key-Value Pairs: Bulk insert key-value pairs from a CSV file.
- Interactive Menu: Provides an intuitive, menu-driven interface for managing operations.

Setup:
- Install Python (if not already installed)
- Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/Himanagi/b-tree-os.git
cd b-tree-os
- run the program: python index_manager.py
- follow the prompts in the menu to create, open, and manage your index files.

usage: 
- Create: Enter the filename for a new indx file. The program will prompt for overwriting if the file already exists.
- Open: Open an existing index file. Only valid files with the correct magic number will be accepted.
- Insert: Add a key-value pair to the open index file.
-search: Search for a specific key in the index file and retrieve its value.
-Print: Display all key-value pairs stored in the B-tree.
-Load: Bulk load key-value pairs from a CSV file.
-Extract: Save all key-value pairs to a CSV file.
-Quit: Exit the program.


future improvements:
-work more on functioanlity anf usablity
-have a delete operation for the B-tree.
-Optimize file I/O operations for better performance.
-add comprehensive unit tests for all functionalities.
